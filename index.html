  "The last 29 games we're 27-2 and Alabama's 28-1," Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney said moments after stepping off the team plane in Tampa, Florida, on Friday afternoon, arriving to take on the Crimson Tide in Monday night's College Football Playoff National Championship. "The two best teams are here. I don't think there's any question about that. Alabama has been the standard for college football. Everybody's been trying to catch up with them a little bit. For us, [being here] says we've become an incredibly consistent program. We can compete at the highest level ... now there's only one thing left to do."

  They have a legitimate chance to do it. They know that. The national conversation leading into the rematch of last season's thriller in Arizona says that everyone else knows it, too. That has created a sense of urgency for those dressed in orange, "urgency" being a kinder way of saying desperation.

  "This team that we have, knowing that for a group of these guys, this is their last game in a Clemson uniform, plus the team across that line of scrimmage, yeah ..." defensive coordinator Brent Venables paused and nodded his head. "There's a real sense of, 'We gotta do this now, this is the climb we've been on together,' that kind of feel to it. No question about it."

  The Clemson team that will take the field Monday night will consist of the most successful recruiting class in program history, led by both the greatest player in program history and a man who might very well already be the greatest coach in program history. The Tigers are back-to-back ACC champions who have lost only two games over the past two seasons and suffered only one loss in their past six bowl appearances, including three College Football Playoff games.

  Yet in spite of that three-ring binder of a résumé, Clemson is not regarded as the greatest program of its time. Instead, the Tigers are merely the latest in a conga line of not-quite-as-awesome-as-you-know-who teams that briefly interrupted the current Tide dynasty, but ultimately succumbed to it.

  How do they avoid being swallowed up into the same hole as the other forgotten would-be champs? They must topple the team that handed them that lone postseason defeat, a 45-40 last-minute soul-crusher in last year's title game.

  "Listen, Alabama is it. We've all said it a lot this week and we said it last year. They are the standard," quarterback Deshaun Watson said Saturday of the team that will be seeking its fifth national championship in eight years. "We're close. We've done so much together. But the king is still the king until someone knocks him off his throne. What they have done is what we all want to do. It's the last thing left that we haven't done together. Win the national championship."

  Watson, widely recognized as the primary reason Clemson can win it, is also the reason for that added infusion of urgency. Among those players Venables referred to who are playing their final game as a Tiger, Watson's imminent departure for the NFL will leave the biggest of those holes to fill ... as in the biggest hole ever filled by any single athlete in the school's 121 years of football.
